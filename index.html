			 <p>Trying to setup a google workspace account this morning, and it keeps funneling me into a plan I do not want with no option to change it during sign up. Allegedly the steps are to just accept the much higher plan and then downgrade, but like, why this user hostile approach? I specifically chose to start with a smaller plan and it still herds me into a much higher priced  plan. So yeah looking for an alternative.</p>

<p>Every time my wife and I go grocery shopping, I keep an eye out for my favorite snack chip. I am pretty moderate about it and only grab a bag once in a while, but for the last few months, they just have not been available. Good for the waist but sad for the soul. Seriously, Paqui chips were the best chip on the market in my opinion. Properly hot, super good texture‚Äîjust leagues better than other similar chips. They were such a treat.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it seems that they are no more. I haven&rsquo;t been able to find them anywhere. It appears the brand has been discontinued.</p>
<p>Someone on Reddit contacted the company and Paqui responded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We hate to be the bearer of bad news, but unfortunately, PAQUI Chips is no longer manufactured for sale. However, the decision to discontinue the brand is not made lightly because we know how disappointing it can be to look for your favorite snack and not find it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So yeah, discontinued. Bummer.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not the entire story. This company also created a product called the One Chip Challenge. A single chip made from the hottest peppers in the world, sold as a gimmick where you &ldquo;take the challenge&rdquo; and post/share your experience on social media. Good marketing, but it got too popular and too accessible imo. A 14yr old kid with a heart condition bought the product, ate it, and died from complications. Paqui discontinued that product quickly and kept shipping their other non-insane products, but it seems the fallout of the One Chip Challenge was too much and the entire brand is gone.</p>
<p>I wanted to make a post about a snack I liked that is no longer available but it&rsquo;s weird to hold both sadness about the loss of a snack in one hand and to know that a child died because of a marketing gimmick from the same snack company. This mix of conflicting emotions‚Äîfondness and grief, nostalgia and sorrow‚Äîis hard to reconcile. It‚Äôs a bittersweet realization, knowing something that once brought joy is now tainted by tragedy. The enjoyment and sadness over a favorite snack being discontinued contrasting sharply with the tragic reason behind its discontinuation. Life is absurd and humans are messy.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s truly remarkable how much a failure this was from an ops perspective. Bypassing client rules for staging and force pushing directly to production without adequate testing coverage or protections in place to ensure a smooth deployment? Wild.</p>
<p>Lessons to be learned from this?</p>
<ol>
<li>Test</li>
<li>Test again</li>
<li>Try rolling releases? I dunno, <em>anything but forcing a <strong>risky</strong> update to all of your clients</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Hindsight being what it is it may be easy to say &ldquo;Oh you just need to have protections in place so this sort of thing cannot happen&rdquo; but it sounds like CrowdStrike did, and deliberately chose to ignore them. Or maybe they just had a gap in those protections and unfortunately found out the hard way. Either way, catastrophic failure on CrowdStrike part. Rebuilding trust is hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good goal to aim for resiliency in your stack and protection <em>from</em> your 3rd party vendors. Being at the mercy of another company for your mission critical operations feels real bad so try to mitigate the impact a failure on their part can have. Easier said than done, for sure, but still something to aim for.</p>
<p>Have backups and a rollback strategy (for when that&rsquo;s possible).</p>
<p>#hugops for everyone still dealing with this.</p>

			 <p>What are your goals as a blogger?</p>
<p>I am asking that question myself and what is coming up is that half of the fun of blogging for me is the public facing side of this, the community, the knowledge sharing.</p>
<p>But the other half for me is actually building the blog. It&rsquo;s cultivating, and caring for, and pruning, and developing a boutique solution that is just my size. That is really, really fun to do!</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I wanted to say anyways. After typing it out I kinda realized that, actually, I just like building things, but building a custom blogging platform for myself is a <em>huge distraction</em> from the other truly important things I want to do :D Also, for real it&rsquo;s the ADHD brain finding a juicy vein from which to suck dopamine and distract from doing the work.</p>
<p>So what do I want out of blogging?</p>
<p>I want to continue to share bite-size tips about software engineering, my love of devops, and to share my learning journey overall. I am currently learning how to be a leader and manager of other people. That is an insane skillset to develop and it might be good to share that experience. I am also learning how to manage ADHD after decades of ignoring it or not believing I had it. Interestingly enough there is a lot of overlap between those two tracks which is something I do want to explore in another post.</p>
<p>Community is also important and part of what makes blogging so fun is the network.</p>
<p>And finally to keep my skills sharp as a web developer type, specifically those skills with Ruby on Rails and Hotwire, I can work on my site monitor, or my wife&rsquo;s CRM, or client work :P</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>n Ruby on Rails, a Form Object is a design pattern used to handle the complexity of forms that don&rsquo;t map directly to a single model or have unique/complex validation and business logic. It encapsulates the logic related to form processing, validation, and data persistence, often combining attributes from multiple models or handling data that doesn&rsquo;t fit neatly into the traditional ActiveRecord model structure.</p>
<p>Consider a UsersController that lets you create or edit a user. Typical CRUD. The form to create and edit a User may require a username or email, password, a full name. But then now consider an InvitationsController, which will also create a User, but this form may only require an email address. Our model validations for User will become a little gross with conditional validations, potentially virtual attributes to act as flags for model callbacks. Enter the Form Object.</p>
<p>A Form Object is a new class that sits between the Controller and the Model.</p>
<h2 id="key-characteristics-of-a-form-object-in-rails">Key Characteristics of a Form Object in Rails:</h2>
<ul>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Encapsulation of Form Logic:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Form objects centralize the form-related logic, keeping controllers and models cleaner by moving validation and other form-specific methods into a dedicated class.</li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Composite Forms:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> They are useful when a form interacts with multiple models. For example, a user registration form might need to create both a User and a Profile model.</li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Custom Validations:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Form objects can have their own validations independent of the underlying models. This allows for more granular control over the validation process.</li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Data Persistence:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> While form objects can validate and manipulate data, they usually delegate the actual persistence of data to the relevant models.</li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Reusable Logic:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> By centralizing form logic, form objects can be reused across different parts of the application, making the codebase more maintainable and DRY (Don&rsquo;t Repeat Yourself).</li>
</ul>
<p>Active Model provides features to implement input filtering and validation. We can lean on Active Model to craft our Form Object, called <code>ApplicationForm</code>.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>class ApplicationForm
  include ActiveModel::API
  include ActiveModel::Attributes

  class &lt;&lt; self

    # This method is used in the controller to create a new instance of the form
    # and populate it with the params from the request.
    # Usage: Lead::LeadGenForm.from(params.require(:lead_lead_gen_form))
    def from(params)
      new(params.permit(attribute_names.map(&amp;:to_sym)))
    end
  end

  def save
    return false unless valid?

    with_transaction do
      submit!
    end
  end

  private

  def with_transaction(&amp;)
    ApplicationRecord.transaction(&amp;)
  end

  def submit!
    raise NotImplementedError
  end
end

</code></pre><p>We include a couple of ActiveModel concerns.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->ActiveModel::API<!-- raw HTML omitted --> automatically gives us validation support! From the docs:</p>

<p>Includes the required interface for an object to interact with Action Pack and Action View, using different Active Model modules. It includes model name introspections, conversions, translations, and validations. Besides that, it allows you to initialize the object with a hash of attributes, pretty much like Active Record does.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Super useful for us.</p>
<p>We also include <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ActiveModel::Attributes.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Basically, this provides a DSL for defining a form object schema and parameter types.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Attributes module allows models to define attributes beyond simple Ruby readers and writers. Similar to Active Record attributes, which are typically inferred from the database schema, Active Model Attributes are aware of data types, can have default values, and can handle casting and serialization.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->To use Attributes, include the module in your model class and define your attributes using the attribute macro. It accepts a name, a type, a default value, and any other options supported by the attribute type.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The attribute method provided by ActiveModel::Attributes is used to define our form inputs.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>class Lead::LeadGenForm &lt; ApplicationForm
  attribute :name, :string
  attribute :email, :string
  attribute :message, :string

  validates :name, :email, :message, presence: true
  validates :email, format: {with: URI::MailTo::EMAIL_REGEXP}

  attr_accessor :lead

  private

  def submit!
    @lead = Lead.new({name: name, email: email, message: message})
    @lead.save!
    LeadsMailer.contact_form_auto_responder(lead: lead).deliver_later
    LeadsMailer.contact_form_notification(lead: lead).deliver_later
  end
end
</code></pre><p>Now in our Controller we can instantiate a new Form Object and use it in our view! Since the Form Object belongs to the presentation layer they can be used in view templates.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>def create
    @lead = Lead::LeadGenForm.from(params.require(:lead_lead_gen_form))

    if @lead.save
      redirect_to :thank_you
    else
      render :new, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end
</code></pre><p>We can use the Form Object just as we would use a model in our view:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;%= form_with model: @lead, url: lead_gen_path do |form| %&gt;
</code></pre><p>One thing I particularly like about this pattern is that I can easily write tests for my Form Objects and do not have to juggle as many model callbacks (and deal with that complexity in tests).</p>
<p>Using Form Objects means I can achieve cleaner, more maintainable code, especially in complex form scenarios.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Swapping variables is a fundamental concept in programming, often encountered in algorithm development and problem-solving scenarios. While the process is straightforward in many languages, Ruby offers its own particularly elegant and concise syntax for this task. Let&rsquo;s first explore the more traditional approaches.</p>
<p>First, you might use a temporary variable.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>a = 10
b = 12
puts &quot;a: #{a}, b: #{b}&quot;

tmp = a 
a = b
b = tmp

puts &quot;a: #{a}, b: #{b}&quot;
</code></pre><p>Outputs:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>a: 10, b: 12
a: 12, b: 10
</code></pre><p>A more clever way to do this is with the Bitwise XOR <code>^</code> operator.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>a = 10
b = 12
puts &quot;a: #{a}, b: #{b}&quot;

a = a ^ b
b = a ^ b
a = a ^ b

puts &quot;a: #{a}, b: #{b}&quot;
</code></pre><p>outputs:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>a: 10, b: 12
a: 12, b: 10
</code></pre><p>Weird, and looks like magic. Why would calling the same operation 3 times work? The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->^<!-- raw HTML omitted --> operator is a method on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Integer<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TrueClass<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FalseClass<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->NilClass<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that performs XOR.</p>
<p>The trick here is that XOR <em>does not lose information</em>.</p>
<p>The way I understand it is it basically does something like:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>a = 1
b = 2
puts &quot;a: #{a}, b: #{b}&quot;

a = a + b # 1 + 2 = 3, a = 3
b = a - b # 3 - 2 = 1, b = 1
a = a - b # 3 - 1 = 2, a = 2

puts &quot;a: #{a}, b: #{b}&quot;
</code></pre><h2 id="the-ruby-way">The Ruby Way</h2>
<p>The Ruby way to do this is actually super elegant! Using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->multiple assignment<!-- raw HTML omitted --> we can just swap the variables.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>a = 1
b = 2
puts &quot;a: #{a}, b: #{b}&quot; # a: 1, b: 2

# Swapping variables using multiple assignment
a, b = b, a
puts &quot;a: #{a}, b: #{b}&quot; # a: 2, b: 1
</code></pre><h2 id="strings">Strings</h2>
<p>What about strings? You cannot subtract a string in Ruby.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&quot;string&quot; ^ &quot;another string&quot;
undefined method `^' for &quot;string&quot;:String (NoMethodError)
</code></pre><p>Could do something like concatenate and substring but that just seems like it&rsquo;s missing the point. Maybe use a temporary variable for strings.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>a = &quot;first&quot;
b = &quot;second&quot;
puts &quot;a: #{a}, b: #{b}&quot; # a: first, b: second

a = a + b # firstsecond
b = a[0..((a.length - b.length)-1)] # first
a = a[b.length..a.length] # second 

puts &quot;a: #{a}, b: #{b}&quot; # a: second, b: first
</code></pre><p>Ruby being awesome though, really just use multiple assignment :D</p>
<h2 id="update">Update</h2>
<p>Okay I am more clear on how XOR actually works.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>XOR is a binary operation, it stands for &ldquo;exclusive or&rdquo;, that is to say the resulting bit evaluates to one if only exactly one of the bits is set.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>a = a ^ b means, if a is 0 or b is 0, return 0. If a is 1 OR b is 1, return 1, if a is 1 and b is 1, return 0. Using our example values of a = 10 and b = 12, and we convert to binary: a = 1010, and b = 1100.</p>
<p>The math looks like:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>a = a ^ b # 1010 ^ 1100 = 0110 (converted to decimal: 10 ^ 12 = 6)
b = a ^ b # 0110 ^ 1100 = 1010 (6 ^ 12 = 10)
a = a ^ b # 0110 ^ 1010 = 1100 (6 ^ 10 = 12)
</code></pre><p>Or, a is now 12, and b is now 10.</p>
