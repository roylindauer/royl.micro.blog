			 <p>4 hours into my work day and I have done maybe 30 minutes of real meaningful work so far. I have spent <strong>90 minutes dealing with slack messages</strong> and reminders. Then another 30 minutes handling emails. I have meetings spread out throughout the day and so there&rsquo;s little ability to do any meaningful work in between and while waiting. Plenty of room for shallow work though. Certainly no room to get deep into anything. Kinda fascinating</p>

			 <p>January is not for getting into the deep work. BUT I have been taking advantage of the morning and doing some foundational drawing practice. Kinda preparing myself to tackle some figure drawing deep work in February.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also had time for coding practice so again, not the point of this month, but I have the time so might as well :D</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s feeling really good.</p>
<p>My intention for this month is to build willpower. To grow this muscle so that I can start to tackle the deep work later. And to break some bad habits.</p>
<p>How am I developing the willpower muscle? By implementing a level of discipline and routine I have never had in my life before. Willpower is at its peak early in the day. It&rsquo;s easier to push yourself to workout and do the things you want to do when you have that willpower. By the end of the day willpower is drained or weak so it&rsquo;s much easier to not do the things, to order out, to play video games, etc. I believe that I can break the bad habits and get into the deep work that matters, by improving willpower, starting by developing this routine and discipline early in the day.</p>
<p>I am going to be early, so I can wake early, because I have setup a few non-negotiables for myself each day.</p>
<ol>
<li>Meditate</li>
<li>Workout/Movement</li>
<li>Get Good Sleep</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, I understand that I am at my best early in the day, so that is the best time to get into the deep work that matters to me.</p>
<p>The rub is, my job generally starts around 830 am each day. That means, in order to have the time to do the things I need to do, I need to go to bed earlier. Historically that has been really fucking hard for me to do.  I have had this personal vendetta against the day so I stay up until midnight or later so I &ldquo;win&rdquo;. Anyways. Getting up early and all of a sudden I have plenty of time to do the non-negotiables, <em>and</em> get in some work, before I even have to think about my day job.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that this means there is less time for the things that are not serving me. I&rsquo;m not playing video games until midnight. Or browsing youtube all night. Or pretending I am learning something but am really not since my faculties are not as sharp as I think they are at 11pm. I am doing more and doing less at the same time. More that matters, more that is important, more that is serving me. Far less of the things that are not.</p>
<p>While not perfect, I am getting good signals that things are moving in the right direction and this plan has merit.</p>
<p>I am meeting the challenge. Looking forward to week 2.</p>

			 <p>January 2025 is going to be a time for <em>doing nothing</em>.</p>
<p>No new projects. No new clients. No learning paths.</p>
<p>The only thing I will be doing, is strengthening my willpower. Willpower is an exhaustible resource. I will develop the muscle so that I can set myself up for success in 2025.</p>
<p>Small steps and small wins add up over time to huge changes. Small wins and changes over time can be hard to track. This blog will be where I track my progress.</p>
<p>I have some big goals for this next year and this first month is going to be crucial for setting things off on the right foot. It&rsquo;s parking downhill. It&rsquo;s setting myself up for success.</p>
<p><strong>What this year is going to be about</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Screen addiction</li>
<li>Willpower</li>
<li>Deep work - leveling up as a web developer</li>
<li>Deep work - leveling up as an artist</li>
<li>Deep work - leveling up as a human</li>
</ol>
<p>But the first thing is to do way less.</p>
<p>I created an outline of things to do this month but I can recognize the ADHD brain getting too excited about process and getting lost in the automations and configuring notion. So yeah, the simple thing I am going to do to get myself parked downhill for February is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan the day ahead of time</li>
<li>Do intensive activity early in the day</li>
<li>Habit stacking</li>
</ul>
<p>And keep it mindful! And have compassion for myself. &lt;3</p>

			 <p>By reading less I have actually been reading more.</p>
<p>Something I learned about myself this year is that, while I love reading, I would speed through a book just to get it done. I was not allowing myself to enjoy the words on the page. I wasn&rsquo;t immersing in the world. I wasn&rsquo;t participating in the world building. I wasn&rsquo;t learning the lessons the book was trying to teach me.</p>
<p>Now I am reading slowly. Literally reading every word, and often going back to re-read sections. It&rsquo;s re-energized my love of reading. Feels good.</p>
<p>By reading slowly I am also teaching my brain to slow down. I think reading slowly is actually going to help me manage ADHD, and also help cure the brain rot that I have inflicted upon myself from severe internet addiction.</p>
<p>This year I have read less books than I usually do, but I can also tell you that I truly <em>read</em> those books.</p>

			 <p>The creator of WordPress throwing shade at other companies because they are not contributing back <em>enough</em> is a bad look.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To make his point, Mullenweg compared the Five For the Future contributions from Automattic and WP Engine, a competitor of similar size. Automattic contributes 3,786 hours per week, while WP Engine contributes just 47.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>40 hours a week contributing back to an open source project seems pretty good. I mean, wtf is this comparison in the first place, Automattic is the governing company for WordPress. WPEngine is a webhost that specializes in hosting WordPress.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is not the first time Mullenweg has discussed this point. ‚ÄúThose who care about the future of WordPress should spend their dollars with less parasitic companies,‚Äù he said in 2022.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pantheon, another host that specializes in WordPress, pledges <em>even less than WPEngine</em>. Are they also parasitic?</p>
<p>Anyways, I think that Automattic would prefer you used their VIP services and spent your enterprise hosting dollars with them rather than WPE or even Pantheon.</p>
<p>Automattic profits from all of the open source contributions and has commercial interest in exploiting those contributors and their efforts. I think, ideally, WordPress would be independent and under the stewardship of a community governing body, and <em>not</em> by a company with commercial interest in the project.</p>
<p>I wonder if the next thing we hear about is a license change similar to what Hashicorp, Redis, Elastic, recently(ish) went through.</p>
<p><strong>update</strong></p>
<p>wow, cringe ass post by creator of WordPress -&gt; <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2024/09/wp-engine/">wordpress.org/news/2024&hellip;</a>
I&rsquo;m not really following the logic. WordPress offers a PHP constant to disable revisions so it&rsquo;s not like WPEngine is mangling things..</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span style="color:#a6e22e">define</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;WP_POST_REVISIONS&#39;</span>, <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>In my experience WP revisions are often a cause of performance issues, so it makes sense to me disable them. Is it weird they do that? Maybe, but its likely due to infrastructure limitations. If you need them use a 3rd party that handles revisions better.</p>
<p>This man hates WPEngine üòÇ</p>
<p>p.s.</p>
<p>Automattic themselves, via Wordpress.com, offers &ldquo;something that they‚Äôve chopped up, hacked, butchered to look like WordPress, but actually they‚Äôre giving you a cheap knock-off and charging you more for it.&rdquo; so the hypocrisy is <em>something</em>.</p>

			 <p>I am working with WordPress a lot more. And so that has me thinking about WordPress a lot more. One thing I cannot shake is how messy the platform feels. And how poor of a developer experience that WordPress provides. It <em>could</em> be better.</p>
<p>I watched this video from Pantheon Developer Advocate, and thought it was interesting. I can feel the frustration - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Hqp63sX7GA">Is more Gutenberg the future of WordPress?</a></p>
<p>This article also nicely illustrates the state of WordPress developer experience -  <a href="https://dbushell.com/2024/05/07/modern-wordpress-themes-yikes/">Modern WordPress - Yikes!</a> Yikes indeed. It&rsquo;s rough.</p>
<p>Wrapping WordPress with your own tooling helps quite a bit!</p>
<p>Anyways, just generally disappointed with WordPress, Gutenberg, &ldquo;Full Site Editing&rdquo;, and all things related to modern WordPress. I like React, and think they could do something really interesting with block based development in WordPress, but the current state is just, meh.</p>

			 <p>My boring regular-ass take about Linux adoption is this: it aint for everyone and that&rsquo;s totally fine.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t more people use it? Let&rsquo;s be honest, Linux asks way more of you than MacOS or Windows does. That&rsquo;s a tall barrier to entry for many people.</p>
<p>I use MacOS, because I don&rsquo;t <em>want</em> to think about my OS any more than I have to. But I run Linux on every server I touch, because I don&rsquo;t want to have to think about my servers any more than I have to :P</p>
<p>I dunno, maybe <em>next</em> year will be the year of Linux on the Desktop</p>

<p>Every time my wife and I go grocery shopping, I keep an eye out for my favorite snack chip. I am pretty moderate about it and only grab a bag once in a while, but for the last few months, they just have not been available. Good for the waist but sad for the soul. Seriously, Paqui chips were the best chip on the market in my opinion. Properly hot, super good texture‚Äîjust leagues better than other similar chips. They were such a treat.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it seems that they are no more. I haven&rsquo;t been able to find them anywhere. It appears the brand has been discontinued.</p>
<p>Someone on Reddit contacted the company and Paqui responded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We hate to be the bearer of bad news, but unfortunately, PAQUI Chips is no longer manufactured for sale. However, the decision to discontinue the brand is not made lightly because we know how disappointing it can be to look for your favorite snack and not find it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So yeah, discontinued. Bummer.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not the entire story. This company also created a product called the One Chip Challenge. A single chip made from the hottest peppers in the world, sold as a gimmick where you &ldquo;take the challenge&rdquo; and post/share your experience on social media. Good marketing, but it got too popular and too accessible imo. A 14yr old kid with a heart condition bought the product, ate it, and died from complications. Paqui discontinued that product quickly and kept shipping their other non-insane products, but it seems the fallout of the One Chip Challenge was too much and the entire brand is gone.</p>
<p>I wanted to make a post about a snack I liked that is no longer available but it&rsquo;s weird to hold both sadness about the loss of a snack in one hand and to know that a child died because of a marketing gimmick from the same snack company. This mix of conflicting emotions‚Äîfondness and grief, nostalgia and sorrow‚Äîis hard to reconcile. It‚Äôs a bittersweet realization, knowing something that once brought joy is now tainted by tragedy. The enjoyment and sadness over a favorite snack being discontinued contrasting sharply with the tragic reason behind its discontinuation. Life is absurd and humans are messy.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s truly remarkable how much a failure this was from an ops perspective. Bypassing client rules for staging and force pushing directly to production without adequate testing coverage or protections in place to ensure a smooth deployment? Wild.</p>
<p>Lessons to be learned from this?</p>
<ol>
<li>Test</li>
<li>Test again</li>
<li>Try rolling releases? I dunno, <em>anything but forcing a <strong>risky</strong> update to all of your clients</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Hindsight being what it is it may be easy to say &ldquo;Oh you just need to have protections in place so this sort of thing cannot happen&rdquo; but it sounds like CrowdStrike did, and deliberately chose to ignore them. Or maybe they just had a gap in those protections and unfortunately found out the hard way. Either way, catastrophic failure on CrowdStrike part. Rebuilding trust is hard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good goal to aim for resiliency in your stack and protection <em>from</em> your 3rd party vendors. Being at the mercy of another company for your mission critical operations feels real bad so try to mitigate the impact a failure on their part can have. Easier said than done, for sure, but still something to aim for.</p>
<p>Have backups and a rollback strategy (for when that&rsquo;s possible).</p>
<p>#hugops for everyone still dealing with this.</p>

			 <p>What are your goals as a blogger?</p>
<p>I am asking that question myself and what is coming up is that half of the fun of blogging for me is the public facing side of this, the community, the knowledge sharing.</p>
<p>But the other half for me is actually building the blog. It&rsquo;s cultivating, and caring for, and pruning, and developing a boutique solution that is just my size. That is really, really fun to do!</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I wanted to say anyways. After typing it out I kinda realized that, actually, I just like building things, but building a custom blogging platform for myself is a <em>huge distraction</em> from the other truly important things I want to do :D Also, for real it&rsquo;s the ADHD brain finding a juicy vein from which to suck dopamine and distract from doing the work.</p>
<p>So what do I want out of blogging?</p>
<p>I want to continue to share bite-size tips about software engineering, my love of devops, and to share my learning journey overall. I am currently learning how to be a leader and manager of other people. That is an insane skillset to develop and it might be good to share that experience. I am also learning how to manage ADHD after decades of ignoring it or not believing I had it. Interestingly enough there is a lot of overlap between those two tracks which is something I do want to explore in another post.</p>
<p>Community is also important and part of what makes blogging so fun is the network.</p>
<p>And finally to keep my skills sharp as a web developer type, specifically those skills with Ruby on Rails and Hotwire, I can work on my site monitor, or my wife&rsquo;s CRM, or client work :P</p>

<p>Once upon a time, I was fortunate enough to attend DevOpsDays Denver. It was incredible, I had so much exposure to so many informative talks, community leaders, and great ideas. It was inspiring. I came home fired up. I was missing that, then Covid hit, and I just didn&rsquo;t try to get involved.</p>
<p>At the end of summer last year I saw that DevOpsDays LA was a thing, and was happening around my birthday in &lsquo;24, and happening in person! Heck yeah. We have family in LA and it&rsquo;s a short 8-hour drive.</p>
<p>What I didn&rsquo;t expect was that DevOpsDays LA was part of, or participating in, a much larger event called the <a href="https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/21x">Southern California Linux Expo, or SCaLE</a>.</p>
<p>Even more exciting than one event about something I am passionate about is, a mega conference about many little geeky things I love.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Anyway, it was super fun. I can&rsquo;t wait to go back next year. Now that I understand what the event is, I feel I can immerse more easily and connect more with vendors, developer relations teams, and all of the participants. I was a tad guarded and next time I would engage way more! Also, it was fun to dust off the camera and get a few shots :D</p>
<p>Some quick takeaways from the event:</p>
<p><a href="https://helpingimprove.com/">Paul Tevis&rsquo;s talk on &ldquo;Three Heuristics for Fostering High-Trust, Generative Culture&rdquo;</a> was fantastic. I walked away with a very nice set of tools for looking at how I may be perceived by others in my organization, and how to shift back into the sweet spot using the three heuristics. It was all about the flow of information and how I could lead by example. Super relevant to my current role at Noble Studios.</p>
<p>Secrets management is going to be very feasible for us at Noble.</p>
<p>State of DevOps is, well, it&rsquo;s just how a business runs now. It&rsquo;s how we do things. It&rsquo;s a culture, a toolchain, and YAML wrangling ;)</p>
<p>Shift Left on security makes perfect sense. I had a great conversation during the open group at DevOpsDays about security and how teams are running it in their workflows. A fun future attack vector we gotta think about now is like typo-squatting for AI, but for the hallucinations, it sometimes creates for packages that do not exist. Someone could just, create them, poison the data, and wreak havoc. Good times.</p>
<p>OpenSource is important.</p>
<p>There are a lot of amazing groups working to ensure that Open Source projects are of high quality and cared for, and that we are all educated in those regards so that we can choose Open Source packages to use in our projects or day to day with confidence and with security in mind.</p>
<p>These events are also important. It&rsquo;s healthy to get away from the screens and get in the same room and talk.</p>
<p>Picked up some great ideas around measuring the value of community events to help ensure they continue to happen.</p>
