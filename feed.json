				"content_text": "<p>Started a new project. Super excited. All in. So much momentum and so much progress being made. Wow. First week in and I am feeling really good about this project. Nothing is more imprtant. Every thing is electric.</p>\n<p>And then I wake up at the start of week two, and, nothing. I just don’t care about this anymore. But, hey that looks cool, that’s a neat idea. Let’s build that thing!</p>\n<p>Forever this loop, until I die.</p>\n<p>Or probably not. But damn this loop is something. Just one of those things I have learned is part of having ADHD. Good to know, wish I knew it earlier. Still, good to know. I’m not just, lazy, or bad at this.</p>\n<p>There is a problem of momentum. I have an interest-based nervous system, and if this shit is not making my brain light up then it’s just not gonna happen. So I gotta hack it. Trick it. Use it. There’s a bit of self parenting I have to do. Discipline I also need to figure out. As you can imagine this makes a job difficult. Unexciting work is <em>painful</em> to do. But it’s possible. My problem is actually in the work I do outside of work. My hobbies, and other projects. They collect dust and die.</p>\n<p>Things to try:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Long term rewards means nothing. Which does make long term planning more challenging. Short term rewards may be effective. That means, get a coffee for doing the task, buy yourself something for a hobby, and so on.</li>\n<li>Accountability buddy with my wife. There can be equal exchange as I can help her with her goals as well.</li>\n<li>Try to gamify the thing. Make a game out of it. Make a rewards system.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I guess that’s literally all of the options :D</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Watched a really fantastic video from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@HealthyDev\">Healthy Software Developer</a> about how <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtextKpPO-w\">unchecked learning can be a dangerous addiction that can actually damage your software development career</a>.</p>\n<p>The bit that resonated with me, and had me feeling deeply personally attacked, was the bit about using tech learning as a way to procrastinate. Learning a new technology, or language, or framework, when I should be doing something else that I am responsible for. I felt that.</p>\n<p>I sat with my thoughts afterwards. Reflecting on my habits over the last 2 years. And yeah, not only have I been addicted to tech learning, I am doing it out of fear as well as a way to procrastinate.</p>\n<p>I recommend watching the video as he touches on many signs and traits of this sort of addiction and has some tips on when to (and not to) learn.</p>\n<h2>Procrastination and Distraction</h2>\n<p>My current job is a leadership role where I can act as mentor to other developers, and grow/scale my team into a high performing group. There is a shit load to learn, it’s an entirely new skill set. However instead of <em>learning those skills</em>, I have been learning things like GoLang, PHP Laravel, NextJS and ReactJS, HTMX, Kubernetes, etc. I mean, endless stuff, because it’s 1) comfortable and familiar, and 2) a good distraction from a real challenge that I have in front of me.</p>\n<p>I have also been using it as a way to procrastinate from doing other things in my life that are important. For example I <em>had</em> to learn an entirely new deployment strategy and toolkit to deploy my wife’s app because doing it to the old way was old. More destructively, I have been spending my evenings doing busy work instead of spending time with my wife and playing with my dog. I am not taking any time for leisure or relaxation. Work got stressy, so I got distracted.</p>\n<p>I spent like 3 weekends doing almost nothing but building a Laravel app “to learn the framework” instead of getting a head start on weeding my garden, working on my adhd studies and practice, and doing chores around the house. I learned some things, but I didn’t need to learn those things.</p>\n<p>I had some things come up at work that were very difficult, and instead of reflecting and working on that I bought some books and online courses.</p>\n<p>Learning and reading is a familiar place. I often go here when things get difficult.</p>\n<h2>Fear</h2>\n<p>I had the rug pulled out from under me in 2022 when the company I was working for closed their doors. It shook me to my core. I was in a panic. And I began my job search. I was doing “DevOps” for the last 5 years, running infrastructure, pipelines, and automation for a cannabis startup. I learned a lot and my skills were fine. Like I know my shit. BUT. All of a sudden I am very vulnerable and I start questioning myself. Every job wants GoLang and K8S, or Rust and GCP. At least that is what the narrative unfolding in my brain is telling me. I start to think that my 20-ish years of development experience, 5+ years of devops experience, are no longer viable. And so I start to over commit to learning paths upon which I think my career depends.</p>\n<p>The problem is that I was not growing the skills that really matter when it comes to being a good prospect and good employee. I also was not getting really deep into the stack I was learning, so it was not like I was going to bring anything as a fresh Go developer ya know. I mean, yeah you gotta know how to program, you gotta know how to manage linux systems, docker, and so on. But you also need good communication skills, a different set of problem solving skills, leadership qualities. And if I was going to be more of an individual contributor, it would have been more valuable to dive deeper into what I know than to try to add some surface level knowledge of many other tools to my kit.</p>\n<p>I am also untangling years of untreated ADHD that have contributed to much of the fear and distraction. That has added some spiciness to the problem for sure!</p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>While reflecting I realized that so much of my time in the last 2 years has been spent in a fear state, frantically trying to learn everything I can at at surface level, that I have neglected the real path of growth in front of me. I was also using it as a way to keep myself distracted so I didn’t have to face the real challenges I have going on in my life.</p>\n<p>What I know now, more deeply than I knew this morning. Is that my time is better spent facing the fear head on and being more skillful around what I commit to learning and how I do it.</p>\n<p>I am always going to be a student. Moving forward I will be more skillful and mindful of how I approach that.</p>\n",
